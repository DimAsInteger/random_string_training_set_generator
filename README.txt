random_string_training_set_generator.R can be used to generate a fasta formatted random RNA, DNA, or string sequence list. Specifically, the user can tailor the code to generate a variety 
of random or probability-based sequence strings as needed. In bioinformatics, random or weighted sequences can be used to evaluate the significance of sequence analysis results. 
Additionally, random dna sequences can be used in evaluating of multiple sequence alignment algorithms and Monte Carlo simulations.
